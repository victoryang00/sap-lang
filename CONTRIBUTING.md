In view of the fact that the law `GPLv3` of the country where I live is classified as copyright in jurisprudence, but currently other open source agreements are not supported by the law, so I hope you understand.
At the same time, if the more lenient agreement is supported by the jurisprudence in my country, I will notify you and change the open source agreement of the project, for example switching to `3-clause BSD`. 

鉴于我所处的国家的法律`GPLv3`在判例上是被划分成著作权的，但是其他的开源协议并不受法律支持，所以希望大家理解。
同时，如果更加宽松的协议在我所在的国家获得了判例上的支持，我会通知你并更改项目的开源协议，如切换到`3-clause BSD`.
